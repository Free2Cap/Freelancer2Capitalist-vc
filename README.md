Notice Board!!
i am done with login and registration page. I think otp verification is going to be tricky 
is it seems paid. So, let keep hold on it. First of all i want you to make a page which helps 
completing registration. the fields may incude:
1. Profile picture
2. Name 
3. surname
4. gender
5. freelancer/investor
Notify me when this page is complete then i will complete the backend part.
=> Once you are done with complete profile page i want you to make a separate drawer page i want to 
make it global because once complete profile page is done we need to start working on the main 
application. We mainly need following things in the drawer and rest is up to you:
1. profile image on top
2. Title as name and surname
3. subtitle investor/freelancer
//Now starts main drawer contents
4. Dashboard/Home
5. chat panel
6. forum
7. profile
8. logout
=> we will deal with profile page later when we are done with this. This is all for now Thank you
for your attention.
